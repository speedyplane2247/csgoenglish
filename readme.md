# csgo_english re-write
This is a re-write of csgo_english.txt, cleaning it up and adding useful features with a lower size and faster loading times.
## Custom commands
You can use 'disconnect #misc_command' (where command is your command) to access some information.
## Unable to Use
If you can't use the csgo_english.txt file, try encoding it in UCS-2 LE, as this is required for the Source Engine. GitHub automatically converts it to UTF-16, so this may be a problem. Thanks!
